These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.  

I would describe myself as a dedicated, self-motivated, and quick learner with a keen interest in embracing challenges and opportunities for growth.  

Apart from academics, I enjoy taking on leadership roles and listening to music, which helps me stay balanced and creative.
