
General Questions:

1. Can you briefly describe your academic project?  
   My project is "Sunshine Home Décor Application," a C#.NET desktop-based application designed to automate the overall shop management process. It helps in product management, pricing, billing, and generating reports for business analysis.

2. What was the objective of your project?  
   The main objective was to digitalize the shop’s operations, making it easier to manage product inventory, staff, suppliers, billing, and reporting efficiently while reducing manual work.

3. How did you choose this project?  
   I wanted to build a real-world business application that helps small and medium-sized businesses manage their daily operations smoothly. Retail and home décor shops often struggle with inventory and billing, so this project provides an efficient computerized solution.

4. What technologies/tools did you use?  
   - Frontend: C#.NET (Windows Forms)  
   - Backend: Microsoft SQL Server  
   - Reporting: Crystal Reports  
   - Development Tool: Visual Studio  

5. What was your role in the project?  
   I was responsible for backend database design, coding the business logic, and integrating Crystal Reports for generating shop-related reports.

6. Did you work individually or in a team?  
   I worked with a team of three members. My role focused on database management and report generation, while my teammates handled UI design and testing.

Technical Questions:

7. What challenges did you face during development, and how did you overcome them?  
   - Data Handling: Managing large amounts of product and billing data was challenging. We solved it by using optimized queries and indexing in SQL Server.  
   - Dynamic Pricing Management: We used stored procedures to update and manage product prices dynamically.  
   - Report Generation: Formatting reports in Crystal Reports took time, but we resolved it by using grouping and parameterized filters.

8. How does your project work? Can you explain the architecture?  
   - The project follows a three-tier architecture:  
     1. Presentation Layer: User interface built in C#.NET Windows Forms  
     2. Business Logic Layer: Contains C# classes for handling shop operations  
     3. Data Access Layer: Manages database interactions using Microsoft SQL Server  
   - The application allows adding/modifying products, billing customers, and generating reports on sales, staff salaries, and distributors.

9. What programming languages and frameworks did you use?  
   - C#.NET for the desktop application  
   - Microsoft SQL Server for database management  
   - Crystal Reports for generating reports  

10. How did you ensure security and performance in your project?  
    - Implemented role-based authentication to restrict access to different users.  
    - Used stored procedures and indexing to speed up database queries.  
    - Applied data validation at both the frontend and backend to prevent errors.  

11. Did you implement any algorithms? If so, can you explain them?  
    - Used an inventory update algorithm to manage real-time product stock updates.  
    - Implemented dynamic pricing logic to adjust prices based on supplier costs.  

12. Did you use any database? If yes, which one and why?  
    Yes, we used Microsoft SQL Server because it is scalable, secure, and supports stored procedures and transactions, which are essential for handling billing and product data.

13. What API integrations (if any) did you use?  
    - Integrated Crystal Reports API for generating sales and billing reports.  
    - Used SMTP API to send automated customer invoices via email.  

14. How did you handle debugging and testing?  
    - Used Visual Studio’s debugging tools to find and fix errors.  
    - Performed unit testing for individual modules.  
    - Conducted database load testing to check performance under high data load.
