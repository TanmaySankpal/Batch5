
 General Questions:

1. Can you briefly describe your academic project?  
   My project is an Event Management System built using C#.NET and MSSQL Server, with Crystal Reports for generating event reports and SAP integration for resource management. It helps users plan and manage events like weddings, conferences, and corporate meetings.

2. What was the objective of your project?  
   The goal was to create a simple and efficient event management tool where users can book venues, manage guests, handle budgets, and generate event reports.

3. How did you choose this project?  
   Event planning is a common problem, and many people struggle with organizing and tracking event details. I wanted to create a solution that simplifies event management using technology.

4. What technologies/tools did you use?  
   - Frontend: C#.NET (Windows Forms)  
   - Backend: MSSQL Server  
   - Reporting: Crystal Reports  
   - Integration: SAP SDK (for resource tracking)  
   - Development Tools: Visual Studio  

5. What was your role in the project?  
   I was the lead developer and worked on database design, UI development, SAP integration, and report generation.

6. Did you work individually or in a team?  
   I worked with a team of 3 members. I handled backend and integration, while others worked on design and testing.

 Technical Questions:

7. What challenges did you face during development, and how did you overcome them?  
   - SAP Integration: It was difficult at first, but I learned to use SAP Business One SDK to connect it with our system.  
   - Report Formatting: Some reports were not displaying correctly, so I fixed them by using proper formatting and filters.  
   - Database Performance: Queries were slow, so I optimized them using stored procedures and indexing.

8. How does your project work? Can you explain the architecture?  
   - It has a three-layer architecture:  
     1. Presentation Layer (C#.NET Windows Forms)  
     2. Business Logic Layer (C# classes for event processing)  
     3. Data Access Layer (MSSQL Server for data storage)  
   - Users add event details, manage bookings, generate reports, and the system syncs data with SAP.

9. What programming languages and frameworks did you use?  
   - C#.NET for the application  
   - MSSQL Server for database  
   - SAP SDK for resource tracking  
   - Crystal Reports for generating event reports  

10. How did you ensure security and performance in your project?  
    - Used login authentication to prevent unauthorized access.  
    - Used parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection.  
    - Optimized queries with stored procedures for better performance.  

11. Did you implement any algorithms? If so, can you explain them?  
    - Used a seat allocation algorithm to manage guest seating efficiently.  
    - Used an event budget calculator to help users estimate costs.  

12. Did you use any database? If yes, which one and why?  
    Yes, I used MSSQL Server because it is reliable, scalable, and supports stored procedures.

13. What API integrations (if any) did you use?  
    - SAP Business One SDK to track event resources.  
    - Crystal Reports API to generate reports dynamically.  

14. How did you handle debugging and testing?  
    - Used breakpoints in Visual Studio to debug.  
    - Performed unit testing to check business logic.  
    - Conducted user testing to get feedback on usability.

15. What is the real-world application of your project?  
    It can be used by event planners, wedding organizers, and corporate companies to manage events, track expenses, and generate reports.

16. If you had more time, what improvements would you make?  
    - Add online booking to allow clients to book venues from a website.  
    - Improve UI design using WPF for a better experience.  
    - Add a mobile app version for on-the-go access.  

17. What feedback did you receive from your professors or peers?  
    - My professors appreciated the real-world application and SAP integration.  
    - Some suggested adding a mobile version for better usability.  

18. How does your project differ from existing solutions?  
    - It is custom-built for event management with SAP integration.  
    - Provides detailed financial and booking reports with Crystal Reports.  
    - Supports real-time seat and venue tracking.  

19. Did you publish your project on GitHub or any platform?  
    Yes, I uploaded a simplified version on GitHub (without SAP-sensitive data). I can share the link if needed.

20. Have you considered converting this project into a startup or a product?  
    Yes, I believe it can be converted into a SaaS-based event management software for businesses.
