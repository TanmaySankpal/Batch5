1. Can you briefly describe your academic project?  
   My project is "Furniture Shop Billing System," a C#.NET desktop application that helps furniture stores automate their billing and invoicing process. It manages customer purchases, payment transactions, inventory tracking, and sales reports efficiently.

2. What was the objective of your project?  
   The main goal was to digitize the manual billing process, reduce errors, and provide a fast and user-friendly system for managing invoices, inventory, and payments.

3. How did you choose this project?  
   Furniture stores often face challenges in handling billing, tracking inventory, and managing customer data manually. I wanted to create a simple yet effective system that automates these tasks.

4. What technologies/tools did you use?  
   - Frontend: C#.NET (Windows Forms)  
   - Backend: Microsoft SQL Server  
   - Reporting: Crystal Reports  
   - Development Tool: Visual Studio  

5. What was your role in the project?  
   I worked as the lead developer, focusing on database design, billing logic, and report generation.

6. Did you work individually or in a team?  
   I worked in a team of three. My role was backend development and data management, while my teammates worked on UI design and testing.

 Technical Questions:

7. What challenges did you face during development, and how did you overcome them?  
   - Real-time calculations: Ensuring accurate tax and discount calculations was a challenge. We solved this by using dynamic formula-based calculations in C#.  
   - Inventory management: We implemented an auto-update feature to track stock levels after each sale.  
   - Report generation: Formatting reports was complex, but we used Crystal Reports with filtering options to make them user-friendly.

8. How does your project work? Can you explain the architecture?  
   - It follows a three-tier architecture:  
     1. Presentation Layer: User interface built in C#.NET Windows Forms  
     2. Business Logic Layer: Handles billing, inventory updates, and calculations  
     3. Data Access Layer: Stores all data in Microsoft SQL Server  
   - The system allows adding/modifying furniture items, billing customers, applying discounts, and tracking payments.

9. What programming languages and frameworks did you use?  
   - C#.NET for desktop application development  
   - Microsoft SQL Server for database management  
   - Crystal Reports for generating sales and billing reports  

10. How did you ensure security and performance in your project?  
    - Used role-based authentication for data security.  
    - Optimized database queries using stored procedures and indexing.  
    - Applied data validation at both frontend and backend to prevent errors.  

11. Did you implement any algorithms? If so, can you explain them?  
    - Tax and discount calculation algorithm for accurate price adjustments.  
    - Inventory tracking algorithm to automatically update stock after each sale.  

12. Did you use any database? If yes, which one and why?  
    Yes, we used Microsoft SQL Server because it supports large-scale data management, stored procedures, and secure transactions.

13. What API integrations (if any) did you use?  
    - Integrated Crystal Reports API for generating sales invoices.  
    - Used payment gateway API for handling card transactions.  

14. How did you handle debugging and testing?  
    - Used Visual Studio debugging tools to fix errors.  
    - Conducted unit testing to ensure each module worked correctly.  
    - Performed load testing to check system performance under heavy usage.
